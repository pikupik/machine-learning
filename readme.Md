## üöÄ How to Use the Model

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Load the model in your Python script**:
   Here's an example of how to use the pre-trained model:
   ```python
   import joblib

   # Load the model
   model = joblib.load('knn_klasifikasiObt.pkl')

   # Input data (example)
   testing = {'Age': [35],
          'Sex': [1],
          'BP': [2],
          'Cholesterol': [1],
          'Na_to_K': [4.5]}

   # Make a prediction
   prediction = model.predict(testing)

   print(f"Predicted class: {prediction}")
   ```

3. **Run the example script**:
   To see the model in action, run the provided example script:
   ```bash
   python example_usage.py
   ```
