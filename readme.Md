## üöÄ Projects Overview

### 1. **Drug Classification**
- **Description**: Classify drugs based on specific features.
- **Files**:
  - `drug_classification/klasifikasi_obat.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for training, evaluation, and analysis.
  - `model/knn_klasifikasiObt.pkl`: Pre-trained KNN model for drug classification.
  - `dataset/drug200.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing.

- **How to Use**:
  - Run the Jupyter Notebook: `drug_classification/klasifikasi_obat.ipynb`.
  - Use the pre-trained model:
    ```python
    import joblib

    # Load model
    model = joblib.load('model/knn_klasifikasiObt.pkl')

    # Input data (example)
    testing = {'Age': [35],
          'Sex': [1],
          'BP': [2],
          'Cholesterol': [1],
          'Na_to_K': [4.5]}

    # Make prediction
    prediction = model.predict(testing)
    print(f"Predicted Drug: {prediction}")
    ```

### 2. **Crypto Market Analysis**
- **Description**: Perform market analysis and generate trading signals for Bitcoin using technical indicators.
- **Files**:
  - `crypto_analyst/crypto_analyst.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for market analysis and visualization.
  - `dataset/crypto_data.csv`: Historical crypto market data.

- **How to Use**:
  - Run the Jupyter Notebook: `crypto_analyst/crypto_analyst.ipynb`.
  - Explore trading signals, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and MACD indicators.
